    UPDATE COMMENT

    This Sass variable creates a map key value pairs, where each pair consists of the following:
    - the expression on the left represents a key
    - the expression on the right is value associated with that key

    In this case, the values on the right represent the corresponding values for hue, saturation, and lightness 
    of the color names on the left, which are the exact colors intended for usage in the visual 
    appearance of text, buttons, and other visual elements.
    For example "darkBlue" is a key that is a color name, and "hsl(" is a hexcode value that is 
    associated with "darkBlue".

    The map below is used for a simple, but reproducible function called "color($colorName)" that 
    can be used to clearly communicate which color is being to for one or more selected elements.

    This map can be expanded to include more colors other than the ones already listed, and the 
    hexcode values can be conveniently changed so that all elements that uses the same color will 
    have their colors updated to reflect this change.

    For more information on maps and key-value pairs, copy and paste this URL on an article about 
    maps from the Sass official website: https://sass-lang.com/documentation/values/maps/

    UPDATE COMMENT
    This function uses the map from the "$colors" variable to return the desired color included from 
    the map.

    The mapping of color names is necessary to avoid confusion from using color hexcodes on which 
    colors each element is using and to make the code usage of the CSS color property reproducible, 
    more understandable, and with less repetitive code.
